    	<p> 
    		A pattern language has the structure of a network. This is exaplined fully in The Timeless Way of Building. However, when we use the nnetwork of a language, we always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller, always from the ones which create structures, to the ones which embellish those structures, and then to those which embellish the embellishments... </p>
    	<p> 
    		Since the language is in truth a network, there is no one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the sequence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down, dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little like a needle following a tapestry. </p>
    	<p> 
    		The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns. If you read through the sentences which connect the groups of patterns to one another, you will get an overview of the whole language. And once you get this overview, you will then be able to find the patterns which are relevant to your own project. </p>
    	<p> 
    		And finally, as we shall explain in the next section, this sequence of patterns is also the "base map," from which you can make a language for your own project, by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you, and leaving them more or less in the order that you find theem printed here. </p>
    	<p> 
    		We begin which that part of the language which defines a town or community. These patterns can never be "designed" or "built" in one fell swoop-- but patient piece meal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly, and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it. </p>

    			<br> 1. INDEPENDENT REGIONS </br>

    	<p> within each region work toward those regional policies which will protect the land and mark the limits of the cities; </p>

    	<p> in each house cluster and work community, provide the smaller bits of common land, to provide for local versions of the same needs; </p>

    			<br> 67. COMMON LAND </br>

    			<br> 74. ANIMALS </br>

    	<p> within the framwework of the common land, the clusters, and the work communities encourage transformation of the smallest independent social institutions: the families, workgroups, and gathering places. The family, in all its forms; </p>

    			<br> 75. THE FAMILY </br>
    			<br> 76. HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY </br>
    			<br> 77. HOUSE FOR A COUPLE </br>

    			<br> 92. BUS STOP </br>
    			<br> 93. FOOD STANDS </br>
    			<br> 94. SLEEPING IN PUBLIC </br>

    	<p> This completes the global patterns which define a town or a community. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or "build" -- the patterns which define the individual buildings and the space between buildings; where we are dealing for the first time with patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once. </p>

    	<p> The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overalal arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas, and lines of movement through the complex; </p>

    			<br> 95. BUILDING COMPLEX </br>
    			<br> 96. NUMBER OF STORIES </br>
    			<br> 97. SHIELDED PARKING </br>
    			<br> 98. CIRCULATION REALMS </br>
    			<br> 99. MAIN BUILDING </br>
    			<br> 100. PEDESTRIAN STREET </br>
    			<br> 101. BUILDING THOROUGHFARE </br>
    			<br> 102. FAMILY OF ENTRANCES </br>
    			<br> 103. SMALL PARKING LOTS </br>

    	<p> fix the position of individual buildings on the site, within the complex one by one, according to the nature of the site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important moments in the language; </p>

    			<br> 104. SITE REPAIR </br>
    			<br> 105. SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS </br>
    			<br> 106. POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE </br>
    			<br> 107. WINGS OF LIGHT </br>
    			<br> 108. CONNECTED BUILDINGS </br>
    			<br> 109. LONG THIN HOUSE </br>

    	<p> within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of the buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time-- remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang, must always get their shape together; </p>

    			<br> 110. MAIN ENTRANCE </br>
    			<br> 111. HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN </br>
    			<br> 112. ENTRACE TRANSITION </br>
    			<br> 113. CAR CONNECTION </br>
    			<br> 114. HIERAARCHY OF OPEN SPACE </br>
    			<br> 115. COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE </br>
    			<br> 116. CASCADE OF ROOFS </br>
    			<br> 117. SHELTERING ROOF </br>
    			<br> 118. ROOF GARDEN </br>

    	<p> when the major parts of buildings and the outdoor areas have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to give more detailede attention to the paths and squares between the buildings; </p>

    			<br> 119. ARCADES </br>
    			<br> 120. PATHS AND GOALS </br>
    			<br> 121. PATH SHAPE </br>
    			<br> 122. BUILDING FRONTS </br>
    			<br> 123. PEDESTRIAN DENSITY </br>
    			<br> 124. ACTIVITY POCKETS </br>
    			<br> 125. STAIR SEATS </br>
    			<br> 126. SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE </br>

    	<p> now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the buildings: within the various wings. of any one building, work out the fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect the spaces in the gradients; </p>

    			<br> 127. INTIMACY GRADIENT </br>
    			<br> 128. INDOOR SUNLIGHT </br>
    			<br> 129. COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART </br>
    			<br> 130. ENTRACE ROOM </br>
    			<br> 131. THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS </br>
    			<br> 132. SHORT PASSAGES </br>
    			<br> 133. STAIRCASE AS A STAGE </br> 
    			<br> 134. ZEN VIEW </br>
    			<br> 135. TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK </br>

    	<p> within the framework of the wings and their internal gradients of space and movement, define the most important areas and rooms. First, for a house; </p>

    			<br> 136. COUPLE'S REALM </br>
    			<br> 137. CHILDREN'S REALM </br>
    			<br> 138. SLEEPING TO THE EAST </br>
    			<br> 139. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN </br>
    			<br> 140. PRIVATE TERRANCE ON THE STREET </br>
    			<br> 141. A ROOM OF A ONE'S OWN </br> 
    			<br> 142. SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES </br> 
    			<br> 143. BED CLUSTER </br>
    			<br> 144. BATHING ROOM </br>
    			<br> 145. BULK STORAGE </br>

    	<p> then the same of offices, workshops, and public buildings; </p>

    			<br> 146. FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE </br>
    			<br> 147. COMMUNAL EATING </br>
    			<br> 148. SMALL WORK GROUPS </br>
    			<br> 149. RECEPTION WELCOMES YOU </br>
    			<br> 150. A PLACE TO WAIT </br>
    			<br> 151. SMALL MEETING ROOMS </br>
    			<br> 152. HALF-PRIVATE OFFICES </br>

    	<p> add those small outbuildings which must be slightly independent from the main structure, and put in the access from the upper stories to the street and gardens; </p>

    			<br> 153. ROOMS TO RENT </br>
    			<br> 154. TEENAGER'S COTTAGE </br>
    			<br> 155. OLD AGE COTTAGE </br>
    			<br> 156. SETTLED WORK </br>
    			<br> 157. HOME WORKSHOP </br>
    			<br> 158. OPEN STAIRS </br>

    	<p> prepare to knit the inside of the building to the outside, by treating the edge between the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there; </p>

    			<br> 159. LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM </br>
    			<br> 160. BUILDING EDGE </br>
    			<br> 161. SUNNY PLACE </br>
    			<br> 162. NORTH FACE </br>
    			<br> 163. OUTDOOR ROOM </br>
    			<br> 164. STREET WINDOWS </br>
    			<br> 165. OPENING TO THE STREET </br>
    			<br> 166. GALLERY SURROUND </br>
    			<br> 167. SIX-FOOT BALCONY </br>
    			<br> 168. CONNECTION TO THE EARTH </br>

    	<p> decide on the arrangement of the gardens, and the places in the gardens; </p>

    			<br> 169. TERRACED SLOPE </br>
    			<br> 170. FRUIT TREES </br>
    			<br> 171. TREE PLACES </br>
    			<br> 172. GARDEN GROWING WILD </br>
    			<br> 173. GARDEN WALL </br>
    			<br> 174. TRELLISED WALK </br>
    			<br> 175. GREENHOUSE </br>
    			<br> 176. GARDEN SEAT </br>
    			<br> 177. VEGETABLE GARDEN </br>
    			<br> 178. COMPOST </br>

    	<p> go back to the inside of the building and attach the necessary minor rooms and alcoves to complete the main rooms; </p>

    			<br> 179. ALCOVES </br>
    			<br> 180. WINDOW PLACE </br>
    			<br> 181. THE FIRE </br>
    			<br> 182. EATING ATMOSPHERE </br>
    			<br> 183. WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE </br>

    			<br> 185. SITTING CIRCLE </br>
    			<br> 186. COMMUNAL SLEEPING </br>
    			<br> 187. MARRIAGE BED </br>
    			<br> 188. BED ALCOVE </br>
    			<br> 189. DRESSING ROOM </br>

    	<p> fine tune the shape and size of rooms and alcoves to make them precise and buildable; </p>

    			<br> 190. CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY </br>
    			<br> 191. THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE </br>
    			<br> 192. WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE </br>
    			<br> 193. HALF-OPEN WALL </br>
    			<br> 194. INTERIOR WINDOWS </br>
    			<br> 195. STAIRCASE VOLUME </br>
    			<br> 196. CORNER DOORS </br>

    	<p> give all the walls some depth, wherever there are to be alcoves, windows, shelves, closets, or seats; </p>

    			<br> 197. THICK WALLS </br>
    			<br> 198. CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS </br>
    			<br> 199. SUNNY COUNTER </br>
    			<br> 200. OPEN SHELVES </br>
    			<br> 201. WAIST- HIGH SHELF </br>
    			<br> 202. BUILD-IN SEATS </br> 
    			<br> 203. CHILD CAVES </br>
    			<br> 204. SECRET PLACE </br>

    	<p> At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual building. If you have followed the patterns given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You kn ow the height of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know rougly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid out. </p>

    	<p> The next, and last part of the language, tells how to make a buildable building directly from this tough scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail. </p>

    	<p> Before you lay out structural details, establish a philosophy of structure which will let the structure grow directly from your plans and your conception of the buildings; </p>

    			<br> 205. STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES </br>
    			<br> 206. EFFICIENT STRUCTURE </br>
    			<br> 207. GOOD MATERIALS </br>
    			<br> 208. GRADUAL STIFFENING </br>

    	<p> within this philosophy of structure, on the basis of the plans which you have made, work out this complete structural layout; this is the last thing you do on paper, before you actually start to build; </p>

    			<br> 209. ROOF LAYOUT </br>
    			<br> 210. FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT </br>
    			<br> 211. THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS </br>
    			<br> 212. COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS </br>
    			<br> 213. FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION </br>

    	<p> put stakes in the ground to mark the columns on the site, and start erecting the main frame of the building according to the layout of these stakes; </p>

    			<br> 214. ROOT FOUNDATIONS </br>
    			<br> 215. GROUND FLOOR SLAB </br>
    			<br> 216. BOX COLUMNS </br>
    			<br> 217. PERIMETER BEAMS </br>
    			<br> 218. WALL MEMBRANES </br>
    			<br> 219. FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS </br>
    			<br> 220. ROOF VAULTS </br>

    	<p> within the main frame of the building, fix the exact positions for openings-- the doors and windows-- and frame these openings; </p>

    			<br> 221. NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS </br>
    			<br> 222. LOW SILL </br>
    			<br> 223. DEEP REVEALS </br>
    			<br> 224. LOW DOORWAY </br>
    			<br> 225. FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES </br>

    	<p> as you build the main frame and its openings, put in the following subsidiary patterns where they are appropriate; </p>

    			<br> 226. COLUMN PLACE </br>
    			<br> 227. COLUMN CONNECTION </br>
    			<br> 228. STAIR VAULT </br>
    			<br> 229. DUCT SPACE </br>
    			<br> 230. RADIANT HEAT </br>
    			<br> 231. DORMER WINDOWS </br>
    			<br> 232. ROOF CAPS </br>

    	<p> put in the surfaces and indoor details; </p>

    			<br> 233. FLOOR SURFACE </br>
    			<br> 234. LAPPED OUTSIDE WALLS </br>
    			<br> 235. SOFT INSIDE WALLS </br>
    			<br> 236. WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE </br>
    			<br> 237. SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS </br>
    			<br> 238. FILTERED LIGHT </br>
    			<br> 239. SMALL PANES </br>
    			<br> 240. HALF-INCH TRIM </br>

    	<p> build outdoor details to finish the outdoors as fully as the indoor spaces; </p>

    			<br> 241. SEAT SPOTS </br>
    			<br> 242. FRONT DOOR BENCH </br>
    			<br> 243. SITTING WALL </br>
    			<br> 244. CANVAS ROOFS </br>
    			<br> 245. RAISED FLOWERS </br>
    			<br> 246. CLIMBING PLANTS </br>
    			<br> 247. PAVING WITH GRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES </br>
    			<br> 248. SOFT TILE AND BRICK </br>

    	<p> complete the buildin with ornament and light and color and your own things; </p>

    			<br> 249. ORNAMENT </br>
    			<br> 250. WARM COLORS </br>
    			<br> 251. DIFFERENT CHAIRS </br>
    			<br> 252. POOLS OF LIGHT </br>
    			<br> 253. THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE </br>
