    <span style="color: rgb(128,128,0)"> SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE 
 </span><br>A pattern language has the structure <br> of a network. This is exaplined
        fully in The Timeless Way of Building. However,<br> when we use the nnetwork
        of a language, we always use it as<br> a sequence, going through the
        patterns, moving always from the larger patterns<br> to the smaller, always
        from the ones which create<br> structures, to the ones which embellish those
        structures, and then to those which embellish the<br> embellishments...
        Since the language is<br> in truth a network, there is no one sequence which
        perfectly captures it. But the<br> sequence which follows, captures the
        broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips
        down, dips up again, and follows<br> an irregular course, a little like a
        needle following a tapestry.

</div>
<div class="two">The sequence of<br> patterns is both a summary<br> of the language, and at the
        same time, an index to the patterns.<br> If you read through the sentences
        which connect the groups of<br> patterns to one another, you will get an
        overview of the whole language. And once<br> you get this overview, you will
        then be able to<br> find the patterns which are relevant<br> to your own
        project.
        And finally, as <br> we shall explain in the <br> next section, this sequence of
        patterns is also<br> the "base map," from <br> which you can make a language for <br>
        your own project, by <br> choosing the patterns <br> which are most useful to you,
        and leaving them<br> more or less in the order that you <br>find theem printed
        here.
        We begin which that <br> part of the language which <br> defines a town or
        community. These patterns <br> can never be "designed" or "built" <br>in one fell
        swoop-- but patient piece meal growth, <br> designed in such a way that <br> every
        individual act is <br> always helping to create <br> or generate these larger
        global patterns, will, slowly,<br> and surely, over the years,<br> make a
        community that has <br>these global patterns in it.

This completes the <br>global patterns which define a town or a community. We now start that <br>
                part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings <br>
                ,on the land, in three dimensions. <br>These are the patterns which can be "designed" <br>
               or "build">-- <br>the patterns which define the individual buildings and the space <br>
               between buildings; where we are dealing for the<br> first time with patterns <br>
               that are under the <br>control of individuals or small groups of individuals <br>
               , who are able to build the patterns all at once.

The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overalal arrangement of a group of buildings: <br>
               the height and number of <br>these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas <br>
               , and lines of movement through the complex;

    BUILDING <br>COMPLEX
    NUMBER OF STORIES
    SHIELDED PARKING
    CIRCULATION REALMS
    MAIN <br>BUILDING
    PEDESTRIAN STREET
    BUILDING THOROUGHFARE
    FAMILY OF ENTRANCES
    SMALL PARKING LOTS<br>
</div>
<div class="twelve">

fix the position of individual <br>buildings on the site, within the complex <br>
               one by one, according to the nature of the site, the trees, the sun: <br>
               this is one of the <br>most important moments in the language;

    SITE REPAIR
    SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS
    POSITIVE<br> OUTDOOR SPACE
    WINGS OF LIGHT
    CONNECTED BUILDINGS
    LONG THIN HOUSE

within the<br> buildings' wings, lay <br>out the entrances, the gardens, <br>
                courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of the <br>
                buildings and the v<br>olume of the space between the buildings <br>
                at the same time-- remembering that indoor space and <br>
                outdoor space, <br>yin and yang, must always get <br>
                their shape together;

    MAIN <br>ENTRANCE
    HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN
    ENTRACE TRANSITION
    CAR <br>CONNECTION
    HIERAARCHY OF OPEN SPACE
    COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE
    CASCADE OF ROOFS
    SHELTERING <br>ROOF
    ROOF GARDEN

when the major parts of <br>buildings and the outdoor areas have been <br>
               given their rough shape, <br>it is the right time to give more <br>
               detailede attention to the paths and squares between <br>
               the buildings;
    </div>
    <div class="thirteen">

    PEDESTRIAN <br>DENSITY
    ACTIVITY POCKETS
    TAIR SEATS
    SOMETHING ROUGHLY <br>IN THE MIDDLE

now, with the paths fixed, <br>we come back to the buildings: <br>
               within the various wings. of any one building, work out <br>
               the fundamental gradients<br> of space, and decide how the <br>
               movement <br>will connect the spaces in the gradients;

    COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART

    ZEN VIEW
    TAPESTRY OF <br>LIGHT AND DARK
</div>
<div class="fourteen">

within the framework of the <br>wings and their internal gradients of space and <br> movement, define the most important areas and rooms. First, for a house;

    COUPLE'S REALM
    CHILDREN'S <br>REALM
    SLEEPING TO THE EAST
    FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
    PRIVATE <br>TERRANCE ON THE STREET
    A ROOM OF A <br>ONE'S OWN
    SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES

then the same of offices, <br>workshops, and public buildings;

    FLEXIBLE <br>OFFICE SPACE
    COMMUNAL EATING
    SMALL WORK<br> GROUPS
    RECEPTION WELCOMES YOU
    A PLACE <br>TO WAIT
    SMALL MEETING ROOMS
    HALF-PRIVATE OFFICES
</div>
<div class="fifteen">

add those small outbuildings <br>which must be slightly independent <br>from the main structure, <br>
                and put in the access from the <br>upper stories to the street and gardens; 

    ROOMS TO <br>RENT
    TEENAGER'S COTTAGE
    OLD AGE COTTAGE
    SETTLED <br>WORK
    HOME WORKSHOP
    OPEN STAIRS

prepare to knit <br>the inside of the building to the<br> outside, by treating the edge between <br> the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there; 

    LIGHT ON <br>TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM
    BUILDING EDGE
    SUNNY <br>PLACE
    NORTH FACE
    OUTDOOR ROOM
    STREET <br>WINDOWS
    OPENING TO THE STREET
    GALLERY <br>SURROUND
    SIX-FOOT BALCONY
    CONNECTION <br>TO THE EARTH

decide on the arrangement<br> of the gardens, and the places in the gardens;

    TERRACED SLOPE
    FRUIT <br>TREES
    TREE PLACES
    GARDEN GROWING WILD
    GARDEN<br>WALL
    TRELLISED WALK
    GREENHOUSE
    GARDEN<br> SEAT
    VEGETABLE GARDEN
    COMPOST
</div>
<div class="sixteen">

go back to the <br>inside of the building and <br>attach the necessary <br> minor rooms and alcoves to complete the main rooms; 

    ALCOVES
    WINDOW <br>PLACE
    THE FIRE
    EATING ATMOSPHERE
    WORKSPACE <br>ENCLOSURE
    COOKING LAYOUT
    SITTING CIRCLE
    COMMUNAL SLEEPING
    MARRIAGE<br> BED
    BED ALCOVE

fine tune the shape <br>and size of rooms and alcoves to make <br>them precise and buildable;

    CEILING HEIG<br>HT VARIETY
    HE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE
    WINDOWS<br> OVERLOOKING LIFE
    HALF-OPEN WALL
    INTERIOR<br> WINDOWS
    STAIRCASE VOLUME
    CORNER DOORS

give all the walls <br>some depth, wherever there <br>are to be alcoves, windows, shelves, <br>closets, or seats;

    THICK <br>WALLS
    CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS
    SUNNY COUNTER<br>
    OPEN SHELVES
    WAIST- HIGH SHELF
    BUILD-IN <br>SEATS
    CHILD CAVES
    SECRET PLACE

</div>
<div class="seventeen">

At this stage, <br>you have a complete design for an<br> individual building. If you have followed <br>
               the patterns given, you <br>have a scheme of spaces, either <br>marked on the ground, with stakes, <br>
               or on a piece of paper, accurate to <br>the nearest foot or so. You kn ow the height of rooms, <br>
               the rough size and <br>position of windows and doors, and you know rougly how the roofs of <br>
               the building, <br>and the gardens are laid out.

The next, and last <br>part of the language, tells how to make <br>
               a buildable building<br> directly from this tough scheme of <br>
               spaces, and <br>tells you how to build it, in detail.

Before you lay out structural <br>details, establish a philosophy of structure <br>
               which will let the structure <br>grow directly from your plans and your <br>
               conception of the buildings;

   STRUCTURE FOLLOWS <br>SOCIAL SPACES
   EFFICIENT STRUCTURE
    GOOD MATERIALS
    GRADUAL STIFFENING

within this philosophy<br> of structure, on the<br> basis of the plans which you have <br>
               made, work out this complete <br>structural layout; this is the last thing you <br>
               do on paper, before you actually start to build;

    ROOF LAYOUT
    FLOOR AND <br>CEILING LAYOUT
    THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS
    COLUMNS AT <br>THE CORNERS
    FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION
</div>
<div class="eighteen">

put stakes in the <br>ground to mark the columns on the site, <br>
               and start erecting<br> the main frame of the building <br>
               according <br>to the layout of these stakes;

    ROOT <br>FOUNDATIONS
    GROUND FLOOR SLAB
    BOX COLUMNS
    PERIMETER <br>BEAMS
    WALL MEMBRANES
    FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS
    ROOF VAULTS

within the main <br>frame of the building, <br>fix the exact positions for openings--<br>
               the doors and windows-- and frame these openings;

    NATURAL <br>DOORS AND WINDOWS
    LOW SILL
    DEEP <br>REVEALS
    LOW DOORWAY
    FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGE
</div>
<div class="nineteen">

as you build <br>the main frame and its openings, put <br>
               in the following <br>subsidiary patterns where they <br>
               are appropriate;

    COLUMN <br>PLACE
    COLUMN CONNECTION
    STAIR VAULT
    DUCT <br>SPACE
    RADIANT HEAT
    DORMER WINDOWS
    ROOF CAPS

put in the <br>surfaces and indoor details;

    FLOOR <br>SURFACE
    LAPPED OUTSIDE WALLS
    SOFT INSIDE WALLS
    WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE
    SOLID <br>DOORS WITH GLASS
    FILTERED LIGHT
    SMALL PANES
    HALF-INCH TRIM

build outdoor<br> details to finish the outdoors <br>as fully as the indoor spaces; 

    SEAT SPOTS
    FRONT DOOR BENCH
    SITTING <br>WALL
    CANVAS ROOFS
    RAISED FLOWERS
    CLIMBING PLANTS
    PAVING <br>WITH GRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES
