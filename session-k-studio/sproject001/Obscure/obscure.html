    <h1>SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE</h1>
    <div class="first">
      <p>
        A pattern language has the structure of a network. This is exaplined
        fully in The Timeless Way of Building. However, when we use the nnetwork
        of a language, we always use it as a sequence, going through the
        patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller, always
        from the ones which create structures, to the ones which embellish those
        structures, and then to those which embellish the embellishments...
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the language is in truth a network, there is no one sequence which
        perfectly captures it. But the sequence which follows, captures the
        broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips
        down, dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little like a
        needle following a tapestry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the
        same time, an index to the patterns. If you read through the sentences
        which connect the groups of patterns to one another, you will get an
        overview of the whole language. And once you get this overview, you will
        then be able to find the patterns which are relevant to your own
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, as we shall explain in the next section, this sequence of
        patterns is also the "base map," from which you can make a language for
        your own project, by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,
        and leaving them more or less in the order that you find theem printed
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin which that part of the language which defines a town or
        community. These patterns can never be "designed" or "built" in one fell
        swoop-- but patient piece meal growth, designed in such a way that every
        individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger
        global patterns, will, slowly, and surely, over the years, make a
        community that has these global patterns in it.

<h2>This completes the global patterns which define a town or a community. We now start that <br>
